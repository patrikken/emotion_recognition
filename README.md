### Run pretrained model for emotion recognition from your webcam video
To test the final render of the project with the pretrained model run the file 
```
python3 live_emotion_recognition.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
The notebook file """notebook.ipynb""" contains all the steps for the model training
