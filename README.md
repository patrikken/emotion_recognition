# Facial Emotion Prediction

This repository contains the source code for the tutorial on facial emotion recognition. The project is designed taking into account all the steps of a machine learning project. Data collection, data labeling and preprocessing, model training and parameter tuning and finally deployment of the model to a real world scenario.
The required packages are pytorch, OpenCV, torchvision, numpy and matplotlib.

### Run pretrained model for emotion recognition from your webcam video
To test the final render of the project with the pretrained model run the file 
```
python3 live_emotion_recognition.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
The notebook file """notebook.ipynb""" contains all the steps for the model training
